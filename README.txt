The code for each model should be run separately using the data set "ASD1_data".
To run the code:
1) Use the "dataPreprocessing.py" to run the preprocessing code that gives us the "ASD1_data.csv"

2) Run each model using the "ASD1_data.csv" file.

For KNN model, there is the code that rank the features in order of importance.
